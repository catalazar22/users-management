##Functionalities

Each user has a list of attributes such as:
First Name, Last Name, Username, Email, a role(User, HR, Admin, Super Admin), each role with it`s unique authorizations (read, update user, create user, delete user) and a profile picture. Here is also visible the date it was first registered and the last time the user logged in.

In the Users menu, we can see the list with all the users, the attributes they have, we can also edit or delete an existing user, or create a new one.
In this menu, a specific user can be searched by any of it`s attributes in the "Search users" part of the menu.

In order for this changes to be made, a user with the right authorities must be logged in.

Once the user is logged in, in the Users menu, by clicking on the "Delete user" button, the selected user can be deleted, and once the operation is successfull, a notification will pop on the screen to let the user know that the selected user was deleted (as we can see in the image below).

In the Settings menu, if the user lost it`s password, he can recieve an email in which a new temoprary password is sent, in order for him to reset the password and login once more. Once the email address is introduced, and the "Reset password" button is clicked, an automatic email is sent to the mentioned email, and the password is changed.

In the User Profile menu, the logged in user can see all its credentials (except for the User ID and the Password). He can also change the credentials, such as Username, First Name. or even the Profile Picture. If in the moment that the account is created, a Profile Picture is not set by the user, an automated generated picture is set for that account (as we can see below).
